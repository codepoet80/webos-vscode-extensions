VisualStudio Code IDE Extensions

This is a work-in-progress to patch the Palm/HP webOS SDK to include some helpful features for developing with VisualStudio Code, like building, and running (with debug output!) right from the IDE.

Assumes the webOS SDK is already installed.
Run Install-OSX for your platform, then use palm-generate as usual to make a VSCode-ready project.
